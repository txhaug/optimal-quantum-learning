"Optimal training of a variational quantum algorithm" by T. Haug, M.S. Kim

Example code to optimally learn quantum states with variational quantum algorithm. Uses the quantum Fisher information metric to calculate optimal adaptive learning rate for gradient ascent. Further uses generalized quantum natural gradient for optimal movement in parameter space while preserving stability of gradient.
